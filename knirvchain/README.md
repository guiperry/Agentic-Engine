Key Considerations for this Service:

Error Handling: The error handling is basic; you'll want to make it more robust, perhaps with custom error types.
Wallet Management: This service assumes an initialized wallet.Wallet instance is passed to it. The client application (Inference Engine) would be responsible for creating or loading this wallet.
Configuration: The URLs for the Wallet Server and Blockchain Server are configurable.
Context Propagation: context.Context is used for request cancellation and deadlines.
API Endpoint Paths: The paths used (e.g., /wallet/mcp/initiate_register_capability) are based on your documentation. Ensure they match your actual server implementations.
Transaction Construction: The transaction.NewMCPTransaction function is assumed. Its signature and how it handles hashing (especially for the two-step registration's pending hash) are critical.
Plugin Download: The DownloadPluginPackage is a simplified version assuming HTTP(S) for now. Integrating with a P2P layer for knirv:// URIs (as per your SDK docs) would be a more significant undertaking, likely involving libp2p directly or via the KNIRV Client SDK you're planning.
JSON Unmarshalling of Descriptors: When listing or getting capabilities, the service returns json.RawMessage. The caller will need to unmarshal this into the specific descriptor type (e.g., mcp_types.ResourceDescriptor, mcp_types.ToolDescriptor) based on the CapabilityType field present in the BaseDescriptor (which can be peeked from the json.RawMessage).
