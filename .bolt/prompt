For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Proceed with the development by following the detailed guide in the docs/full_implementation_plan.md file. Check and update the docs/full_implementation_worklog.md file as you go as well. Ensure you are not duplicating the previous devs work. Follow the plan closely and implement fully. Please also cross-reference your implementation with the docs/adk_integration_plan.md file as you go as well. It will provide details for the backend golang implementation.
