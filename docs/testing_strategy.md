# Testing Strategy for Frontend Components

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the frontend components of the Agentic Engine. The strategy focuses on ensuring the reliability, functionality, and user experience of the high-priority components identified in the frontend implementation plan.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation, ensuring they render correctly and behave as expected when user interactions occur.

**Key Components to Test:**
- AgentCreationModal
- AgentDeploymentModal
- AgentConfigModal
- AgentManager
- Dashboard

**Testing Aspects:**
- Component rendering
- State management
- User interactions (clicks, form inputs)
- Conditional rendering
- Validation logic
- Error handling

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly, focusing on the interactions between related components.

**Key Integrations to Test:**
- AgentManager with modal components
- Dashboard with navigation to other views
- Complete agent lifecycle (create → deploy → configure → stop)

**Testing Aspects:**
- Component communication
- Data flow between components
- State synchronization
- End-to-end workflows

### 3. Snapshot Tests

Snapshot tests capture the rendered output of components and compare it against previous snapshots to detect unintended UI changes.

**Components for Snapshot Testing:**
- All UI components with stable designs

### 4. Accessibility Tests

Accessibility tests ensure that the application is usable by people with disabilities.

**Testing Aspects:**
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast
- Focus management

## Testing Tools

1. **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework
2. **React Testing Library**: Testing utilities for React components
3. **jest-dom**: Custom Jest matchers for DOM testing
4. **user-event**: Simulates user interactions

## Test Organization

Tests are organized in a structure that mirrors the component structure:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── AgentManager.jsx
│   └── ...
└── tests/
    ├── AgentManager.test.jsx
    ├── AgentCreationModal.test.jsx
    ├── integration/
    │   └── AgentWorkflow.test.jsx
    └── ...
```

## Testing Practices

1. **Component Isolation**: Use mocks for child components and external dependencies to isolate the component being tested.

2. **User-Centric Testing**: Test from the user's perspective, focusing on what the user sees and interacts with rather than implementation details.

3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical user flows.

4. **Realistic Test Data**: Use realistic test data that represents what users will encounter.

5. **Maintainable Tests**: Write tests that are resilient to implementation changes but sensitive to breaking changes.

## Test Execution

Tests can be run using the following npm scripts:

- `npm test`: Run all tests
- `npm run test:watch`: Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage`: Run tests with coverage reporting

## Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run as part of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality before deployment.

## Conclusion

This testing strategy ensures that the frontend components of the Agentic Engine are reliable, functional, and provide a good user experience. By focusing on both unit and integration tests, we can catch issues early and maintain high code quality.
